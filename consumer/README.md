# Queue Consumer Service

Consumers consumer message from queue. When a new consumer is added, assuming there are already messages ready in the queue, deliveries will start immediately.

The target queue can be empty at the time of consumer registration. In that case first deliveries will happen when new messages are enqueued.


## Installation

follow the step below to run the queue consumer

### Clone

- Clone this repo to local using 'https://git.indocresearch.org/platform/service_queue'

### Setup

``
docker build . -t queue-consumer/latest
docker run queue-consumer/latest -d

``

## Thrid party library Documents

pika: 'https://github.com/pika/pika'
kubernetes: 'https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python'

### Queue Connection

```python
import pika

credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(
                ConfigClass.gm_username,
                ConfigClass.gm_password)

            self._connection = pika.BlockingConnection(
                pika.ConnectionParameters(
                    host=ConfigClass.gm_queue_endpoint,
                    heartbeat=180,
                    credentials=credentials)
            )
```

### Routing all route for connecting queue

```python

consumer = QueueConsumer(routing_key='#', exchange_name=ConfigClass.gr_exchange, exchange_type='topic', queue=ConfigClass.gr_queue)

```

### Consuming Queue

```python

consumer.channel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=1)
    consumer.channel.basic_consume(
        queue=consumer.queue,
        on_message_callback=callback)

```


### Load kubernetes configuration

```python

try:
            config.load_incluster_config()
        except:
            config.load_kube_config()

```
